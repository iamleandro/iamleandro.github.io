      <h2>Why is this website's design so... unattractive?</h2>
      <p>I started my personal website with a goal in mind.</p>
      <p>
        I aim to connect with like-minded people who love asking questions and thinking critically about (almost) everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am curious about how things work, and I often wonder about the fundamentals of any subject I am interested in. 
        So, as someone who writes code for a living, I thought, what better way to start than taking a step back and 
        returning to the foundations of the Internet? As a result, I decided to start my website by writing plain HTML 
        with minimal styling and no scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, yes, I agree that the design of my website is unappealing, but I intend to remove all the distractions away 
        from you, my dear guest, so you can focus on what is more important... the ideas!
